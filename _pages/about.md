Hi, I am Anas Al-lahham, a PhD student at the University of Bonn working in the <a href="https://pages.iai.uni-bonn.de/gall_juergen/">Computer Vision Group (CVG)</a> under the supervision of Prof. Juergen Gall. My current research focuses on foundational models for weather forecasting, video anomaly detection (VAD), and early action prediction.

Previously, I earned my Master’s degree in Computer Vision at at [Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI)](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/){:target="_blank"}, UAE in 2023, where I worked as a part of the [SPriNT-AI lab](https://www.sprintai.org/){:target="_blank"} under the supervision of [Dr. Karthik Nandakumar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2qx0RnEAAAAJ&hl=en){:target="_blank"}. I also hold a bachelor’s degree in Electrical Engineering from King Saud University (KSU).


My research interests include Video Anomaly Detection, Early Action Prediction, and Weather Forecasting, with a focus on leveraging advanced computer vision techniques and foundational models to address challenges in these domains.
